# CAN-Python
Among our works in the ADAS project, I needed to read CAN data (500 kb/s and 100 kb/s) to grab the velocity and the steering wheel angle of the car.

I used LONGAN CAN to serial module that you can find here:
https://docs.longan-labs.cc/1030001/
It converts CAN to serial and after that with a USB-to-TTL module, I connected the car to my Jetson (or PC)
